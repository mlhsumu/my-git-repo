   milestone1: html, css and GitHub
   mod1: Version control system, git vs GitHub
   
   what is version control system?
   you can think of a Version Control system  (__aka VCS_) as a kind of database. It lets you save a snapshot of the complete project at any point in time.
   
   Every change made to the project files is tracked, along with
       -> who mad the change
       -> why the change was made ( references to problems fixed or features added in the change)
   
   later when it is required to take a look at an older snapshot/version, VCS shows how exactly it differed from the previous one.  
   
   
   Why version control system is needed?
   1) Collaboration
   If the developers work on a same project different regions, it will be hard for them to collaborate without the version control system
   
   2)
   
   Step1
   
   if want to change the git location on cmd
   thn write git --version -> enter-> select a folder name "D:" -> change D " cd -> space and write which folder u want to change "D:\>cd \projects"
   
   Step2
   and If you want to go back than write " D:\projects>C: " -> C:Users\jahan>cd\projects 
   or newly open this cmd than
       cd \projects-dlt
       cd my-git-repo> git init enter
   and after this if I want to add all file 
   I have to write it "git add ." like this will be C:projects-dlt\my-github-repo>git add . 
   it will take all files
   
   Step3
   C:\projects-dlt\my-git-repo>git commit -m"my first commit"
       
   step4
   
   C:\projects-dlt\my-git-repo>git config --global user.email "mlhsumu@gmail.com"
   
   C:\projects-dlt\my-git-repo>git config --global user.name "mlhsumu"
    
   step5
   up button or C:\projects-dlt\my-git-repo>git commit -m"my first commit"</p>
   
   if i want to search location " git remote -v"
